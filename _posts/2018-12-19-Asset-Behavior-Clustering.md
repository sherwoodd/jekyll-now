title: Asset Behavior Clustering (Aggregate)
---
The goal of this analytic is to find hosts that exhibit atypical behavior compared to their peers. This involves performing clustering analysis on a large number of features representing behavior of a particular machine including the frequency of parent and child processes running, the types of accounts accessing the machine, the average file size, file extension, drive, etc.
