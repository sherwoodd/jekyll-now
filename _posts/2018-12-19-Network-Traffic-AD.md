title: Network Traffic Anomaly Detection (One-class SVM/KNN/Cluster-based)
---
This paper presents a detailed, three-algorithm approach to anomaly detection to find intrusions in unlabeled data. This algorithm should detect malicious behaviors including stealthy reconnaissance attempts, backdoor service on a well-known standard port, natural failures in the network, new buffer overflow attacks, HTTP traffic on a nonstandard port, intentionally stealthy attacks, variants of existing attacks in new environments, and so on.
