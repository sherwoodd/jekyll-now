title: User Behavior Clustering (Aggregate)
---
The goal of this analytic is to find users that exhibit atypical behavior compared to their peers. This involves performing clustering analysis on a large number of features representing behavior of a particular username  including the frequency of parent and child processes running, the types of hosts they access, the average file size, file extension, drive, etc.
