title: Anomalous Login Activity
---
Login activity may not be identifiable as suspicious given a rule or signature-based approach.  This analytics provides a weighted risk score to identify anomalous login activity that can then be screened or review.  This approach considers 12 individual criteria that are weighted and combined.  Weights can be assigned using an analytical hierarchy process with threat experts.
