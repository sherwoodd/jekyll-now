title: Supervised Learning for Intrusion Detection Systems
---
Traditional IDS take in either network data or process data and generate signatures with are binary codes that represent patterns of behavior. They then attempt to match these signatures with a list of known bad signatures and take an action to stop it. This analytic attemps to improve the signature based detection by performing supervised learning to look for and alert on signatures that are "similar to known bad"
