title: Port Scanning Detection (Logistic Regression)
---
Attackers will attempt to gain information about a target and look for vulnerabilities prior to an attack through port scanning. Several scan detection techniques do not scale to very large networks where packet-level information may not be available. This analytic uses a Baysian logistic regression to detect port scanning using only unidirectional flow data.
