Provide scorecards to managers at production sites to track their security hygene progress over time. Incorporates data from a variety of sources to create aggregate views and metrics showing overall vulnerability, update status, and other key descriptions. Previously, client had vulnerability data with no indication of the location/cluster of endpoints. This case involved enriching the data with the site locations, giving a view of the geographic distribution of vulnerability and breakdown of enterprise-wide data into site-specific metrics.
