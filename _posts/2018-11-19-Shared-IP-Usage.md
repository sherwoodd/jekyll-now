title: Shared IP Usage
---
Identify shared use of the same IP address to login to to the same account.  This is intended to detect a threat actor accessing multiple accounts from the same location in a short time window.  This rule-based logic considers the observation of more than one login from the same IP address within 24 hours (or a relevant time window).
