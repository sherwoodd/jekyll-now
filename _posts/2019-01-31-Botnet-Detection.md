title: Botnet Panels Detection with Ensembled Decision Trees
---
Botnets are covert networks of connected devices with massive computational power that are most often leveraged for large-scale email spam operations or denial of service (DOS) attack campaigns. While the typical method of Botnet detection is manually intensive and require expert knowledge, decisions trees and supervised learning can aid in the detection of new botnets with similar characteristics of known bad panels.
