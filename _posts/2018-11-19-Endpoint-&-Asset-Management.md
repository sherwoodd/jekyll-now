Synthesize multiple scanning log sources to create automated list of active assets. Allows for data from multiple sources to be integrated into a singular resource. Consolidated data is used to create a visual dashboard/tool for analysts to track assets, explore new metrics of vulnerability, and benchmark security across entire enterprise.

**Data Sources:**
* DNS
* DHCP
* Endpoint
* Vulnerability Scanners
* Malware Scanner
* Databases

**Data Manipulation/EDA:** All converted to PySpark dictionary objects. Each data source is fit to a standard schema from individual, uniquely structured SQL tables. Manipulation involves extracting relevant data from tables and converting to constant schema to merge information about same assets/locations. As necessary, perform feature engineering/extraction from original tables.
